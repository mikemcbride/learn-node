learn-node
==========

This is a repository containing files used to complete the learnyounode course from [Nodeschool.io](http://nodeschool.io/#workshopper-list).

> **DISCLAIMER:** this repo contains the answers to all problems from the learnyounode project. I highly recommend you work through them yourself. These are not the official answers, but each one passed.

## Install

**Prerequisites:** you will need to have the npm module "learnyounode" installed globally to run these lessons.
```
npm install -g learnyounode
```

**Get set up:**
```
git clone git@github.com:mmcbride1007/learn-node.git
cd learn-node
npm install
```

This will kick off the walkthrough for learnyounode. Each file corresponds to the same numbered exercise in the course. Follow the instructions prompted in the terminal.
